# About the Project: When the user needs a new secure password, they will click the Generate Password button and they are taken through a series of prompts that creates a random password. They have the option to chose if the password has lowercase letters characters, uppercase characters, special characters, and/or numbers. After they go through those prompts, the random password will display on the page.
